<p><em>Developed in Fall 2018 by: Karen Forgette, Kate Hooper, Rachel Johnson, and Don Unger</em></p>
<p>On March 21, 2019, at 6pm in Fulton Chapel, Alexander Heffner, host of PBS’ ​The Open Mind​, will give a  lecture titled “Politics, Media, and the Future of Civil Discourse.” (For more information about Heffner, check  out <a class="reference external" href="https://www.thirteen.org/openmind/about-the-host/">The Open Mind​ website</a>. We hope to use this lecture to initiate a wider discussion at the University of  Mississippi on the nature of civil discourse and the roles that reading, writing, speaking and listening play in  shaping it. To that end, a group of writing and speech instructors, led by Rachel Johnson, met over fall 2018 to  discuss how the topic enters into our curricula and to develop materials for our spring 2019 courses. This  teaching guide resulted from those meetings. As you are contemplating your syllabi, assignments, readings, and  activities for next spring, we encourage you to use these materials, or others, in order to engage students in  conversations about civil discourse. This first section lists texts on civil discourse and related issues. The list items represent scholarly and popular  press articles, as well as podcasts, websites, and other multimedia that may help shape your knowledge of civil  discourse and/or serve as readings for your courses. We divided this list into categories that reflect some aspects  of the national conversation on civil discourse. These categories include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Defining Civil Discourse</p></li>
<li><p>Challenges of Civil Discourse</p></li>
<li><p>Argument and Civil Discourse</p></li>
<li><p>Academic Freedom and Civil Discourse</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The second section describes ​classroom activities ​ related to civil discourse. The third section provides a sample civil discourse mini-unit for first-year writing courses​. Finally, the fourth section offers ​other instructor resources​.</p>

<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.justicetalking.org/ShowArchive.aspx">*Justice Talking​* from NPR</a> Features ​podcast episodes​ about controversial topics in which experts debate and discuss the issue (models civil, yet passionate discourse). Some of the links are older and may be broken, so anything assigned from this may need to be downloaded and hosted on a Blackboard page.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://nicd.arizona.edu/podcasts">National Institute for Civil Discourse Podcast Series</a> The University of Arizona’s National Institute for Civil Discourse hosts a ​series of podcasts​ devoted to civil discourse on a range of issues including fake news, global trade, and the role of satirical media in political debate. These podcasts run from 20 minutes to a bit more than an hour and could be used in class or as homework assignments.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.votersnotpoliticians.com/">Voters Not Politicians</a> Voters Not Politicians is a nonpartisan coalition working to change redistricting laws in Michigan.

The event usually features two prominent thinkers or researchers who present their opposing viewpoints on an issue of concern. The dialogue between the speakers following their short lectures models civil discourse and demonstrates how the speakers tend to agree about several aspects of a problem – perhaps more so than they disagree.</p>

Written for ​communication instructors​, the article informs on dialogic civility and can spark ideas for incorporating the practice in a variety of communication courses, including online.

<p><a class="reference external" href="http://time.com/5434381/tayari-jones-moral-middle-myth/">“​There’s Nothing Virtuous About Finding Common Ground​” by Tayari Jones</a> This​ op ed ​posits that arguments about moving to the middle or finding common ground aren’t inherently virtuous (e.g., where is the middle ground in arguments about slavery? Indentured servitude?). It gets at contemporary issues undergirding what civil discourse means and how part of this discussion means deciding who we want to be as individuals and as a nation.</p>

But you do have to talk to them.​” by Teresa Bejan</a> Professor and political theorist, Teresa Bejan, discusses the limits of civility in public discourse and portions of her​ book​ ​<em>Mere Civility: Disagreement and the Limits of Toleration</em>.​ She offers a lot historical examples of uncivil discourse from figures students might be surprised to learn were rather uncivil - like Martin Luther. Here is a link to a<a class="reference external" href="https://tif.ssrc.org/category/exchanges/book-blog/book-forums/mere-civility/">​scholarly forum</a>​ about Bejan’s book. Each response is concise and provides a specific perspective on her arguments.</p>

<p>Article was published in January 2019 issue of <em>The Atlantic.</em> Based on a psychological study of a contented, suburban town, the article explains how anger is a useful communication tool, which can be used to create positive change and promote resolution in interpersonal relationships, as well as harnessed to facilitate social change. Though anger has an upside, history shows anger has also been manipulated for unethical reasons and that left unchecked, rage can create lasting, harmful effects on individuals and segments of society. Duhigg offers a way to recognize and understand anger and deescalate rage before it turns destructive.</p>
<p>A longer article, an intriguing <strong>discussion or project starter for any class looking at emotion in relation to civil discourse</strong>.</p>

<h3>Argument as a Basis for Civil Discourse<a class="headerlink" href="#argument-as-a-basis-for-civil-discourse" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X6EyVRQe2fnkz5cFs-2_N_CGnO0kCLws/view?usp=sharing">“​Sustaining Arguments” from ​*The Ethical Practice of Critical Thinking*​ by Fowler</a> This short ​chapter​ introduces the idea of a “sustaining argument” as the ethical obligation of a critical thinker. Fowler defines these as “​arguments which matter, about things which matter, to​ ​people who matter to each other​” (5). He goes on to identify specific features of such arguments and explains that argumentation following this model is more likely to find an audience.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xjFYt-vk5gNYS8Gyh1bFIpfJELOAsvRS/view?usp=sharing">“​Reasoning and Critical Thinking​” and “​Clarifying Meaning” by Hughes and Lavery in ​​*Critical Thinking: An Introduction to the Basic Skills​* (5th ed.)</a> These ​two chapters ​are student-friendly in their length and tone. They approach critical thinking as a function of understanding argument. These chapters would be great for having students develop a vocabulary about how to evaluate and understand features of arguments and understand the principle of charity. They would pair nicely with activities related to argument dissection and reconstruction.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1t1r0ArHgboylxuv4HRN6TSnWNXZOMbka/view?usp=sharing">“​Argument as Emergence, Rhetoric as Love​” by Jim Corder</a> This ​article​, published in​ Rhetoric Review​, addresses how people develop ​as​ narratives, and even arguments, or put another way, how to approach these narratives and arguments as who someone is. While such a sensibility might seem a bit abstract and the article is a bit dense for first-year students, I think that they can understand how the arguments that we construct are part of what makes us who we are. Working from this standpoint, the article serves as a reminder for readers/listeners to consider how identity, narrative, and argumentation are deeply intertwined, and Corder encourages readers to show care for another by using rhetoric conscientiously. This article could be used in contrast to articles that emphasize the writer or speaker’s agency as Corder focuses on the listener/reader’s agency.</p>

The concluding portion of the essay discusses several case studies where free speech became an issue in a classroom or higher education setting and discusses how such cases were decided or resolved.</p>

<p><a class="reference external" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nybjI_eYdtes_lfl77de0mWAXRcstU6C/view?usp=sharing">Argument Dissection and Reconstruction</a> The article linked above describes how to incorporate argument diagramming into a first year writing course to teach critical thinking skills. The activities/assignments described could work well as one day lessons or as an entire unit focused on developing or writing sound arguments.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zLM7m2ddXvbcu8MXuvh88pdRH3LCAgiW/view?usp=sharing">Developing a Classroom Code of Civility</a> Designed for presentation courses such as Public Speaking but may be adapted for any course in which civility may be promoted. At the end of this single-class activity, students will have an understanding of civility in order to: (1) identify civility and consequences of behaviors, (2) create their own communication civility code for classroom behaviors and presentations, and (3) practice civility throughout the semester.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aT6sy7lBfJjlSzMDTeb0MtHgECCz_kAz/view">Inquiry-based Civil Discourse</a> This lesson from the journal Communication Teacher is appropriate for speech or writing classes focused on civil discourse, argumentation, debate, persuasion or political communication. The unit activity will help students build an understanding of civil discourse and its function in society. Students will: (1) increase their capacity to examine arguments critically, (2) enhance their own ability to self-reflect critically, and (3) improve their ability to engage in civil discourse. This activity will employ inquiry-based learning strategies to apply students’ understanding of civil discourse in a dialogue with the broader campus community by partnering with campus media to develop and publish original opinion-editorial pieces. Because the DM may not be able to accomodate, classes could partner with various papers around the state, DWR could potentially host a FB or other social media page for published works in relation to the Civil Discourse, or speech students could verbally present their ideas to partner classes or an invited public audience.</p>
