Using *Callings* in the Classroom
--------------------------------------------

Why does UM have a Common Reading Experience Program? 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Common Reading Experience is a shared intellectual event for members
of the UM community. Through reading and considering a common book,
students engage with each other and UM faculty in exploring issues
relevant to today's global community. The Common Reading Experience
helps students understand the expectations of college-level academic
work, the nature of scholarly inquiry, and the values of an academic
community. The program also enriches students' campus experiences
through co-curricular programs and events related to the book. The
Common Reading Text is used in EDHE classes, Writing 100/101 classes,
and other classes on campus. For more information about the Common
Reading Experience visit http://umreads.olemiss.edu/.

What are the Common Reading Experience student learning outcomes?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By reading, writing, and learning together through the shared venture of
the UM Common Reading Experience, students:

-  Develop critical thinking, reading, writing, and research skills and abilities.

-  Gain an emerging sense of confidence as learners, thinkers, readers, and writers.

-  Develop a sense of community among peers, neighbors, and instructors.

-  Develop connections among ideas, experiences, disciplines, and academic and personal goals.

-  Relate the issues raised by the common book to their lives as new or returning students.

Why was *Callings* selected?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Callings* is a collection of stories about the jobs and careers held by
a wide-ranging group of Americans. Isay and his team selected the
contents in *Callings* from over 65,000 stories collected by StoryCorps,
and the accounts run from street-corner astronomer to beer vendor to
physician to U.S. Congress member, with so much in between. These
stories illustrate the devotion the subjects have for their work and the
journeys they took to their chosen fields. The book is a product of
Isay's `StoryCorps <https://storycorps.org/>`__ project, the goal of
which is to record and archive the stories of America's diverse and
fascinating population.

Who is Dave Isay?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dave Isay is an author, radio producer, and the founder of
`StoryCorps <https://storycorps.org/>`__ and Sound Portraits
Productions. He has won numerous awards for his work, including six
Peabody Awards, two Hillman Prizes, a TED Prize, and a MacArthur
fellowship. Some of Isay's most notable edited collections include
*Listening Is an Act of Love: A Celebration of American Life from the
StoryCorps Project* and *Mom: A Celebration of Mothers from StoryCorps*.

How do I teach non-fiction?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Common Reading Experience provides students and teachers in all
disciplines a chance to interact with a shared text. Critical analysis
of texts may feel like foreign territory to some teachers; however,
analysis is a skill that is useful in all areas of education and beyond
and can be approached in ways with which teachers are comfortable.
Writing classes use the Common Reading Text as the basis of a major
project, but work with the book in other classes does not need to be so
in-depth or take up entire class periods. Try to implement short
in-class discussions, homework assignments, response papers, or journal
writings using the themes and prompts listed in this guide. Or ask
students to examine the choices Isay makes as an editor and how they
impact us as readers. Remember that you can concentrate on a few stories
that relate specifically to the themes of your course. This resource
guide should provide starting points for discussions, homework, and/or
writing assignments that will challenge students.

How do I encourage students to read?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Before assigning reading:**

-  Preview *Callings* with students. Introduce the book during class. Explain how the book will be used in the course and how it will help students meet learning outcomes. Share your own excitement about the book, perhaps describing some favorite passages, events, or people.

-  Help students understand the depth of reading required. Display a passage, and model critical reading strategies such as text annotation and marginalia.

**As students read:**

-  Provide focused questions for students to consider while they are reading. Ask them to respond to those questions in writing before the next class.

-  Have students identify and submit a discussion topic or question via email or Blackboard after they have read an assignment but before the next class meeting. Use their topics and questions as the basis for class activities.

-  Require students to keep a reading response journal in which they comment on or question the reading assignment.

-  Ask students to underline/highlight several passages from a readingassignment. In class, ask students to discuss one of their underlined/highlighted passages.

**After students have read:**

-  Use class time and activities to build on, rather than summarize, the reading assignment.

-  At the start of class, assign a one-minute paper in which students identify both the most crucial part of the reading assignment and an unanswered question they have about the reading assignment.

-  During the first few minutes of class, ask students to write about links between the reading assignment and the topic being discussed in class.

-  Distribute one or two questions that build on the reading assignment. Use the think-pair-share protocol. Students first consider the question(s) on their own. Then they discuss the question(s) with a partner. Finally, they share their results with the class.

How do I lead a class discussion?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A good class discussion, like any part of teaching, should be structured
yet open to improvisation. Following are some pointers for leading a
discussion based on what students have read (or even their attendance at
an event).

**Preparation before the class meeting:**

Though you may have already read the stories, be sure to review what the
students are reading for your class meeting. Make a list of what you
would like your students to learn from this exercise in order of
importance.

-  For instance, you might prioritize that students understand what they read.

-  Then, you might select a couple of scenes or events in the book that seem important or interesting (or even puzzling – just because you are leading class discussion does not mean you need to have all the possible answers).

-  Perhaps you have selected several themes in the stories as your focus. You might choose scenes that relate to collegiality, perseverance, or the influence of mentors.

-  You might also ask students to respond to a specific quotation or passage.

-  Jot down a few notes so you can access them easily during your class discussion.

-  Annotate your own text.

**Class time:**

-  Establish respect. Class discussion is a time for exploration, and the classroom is a safe environment for students to say what they are thinking. Remind students of the first rule of the University creed: “I believe in respect for the dignity of each person.” Be sure students are listening carefully to each speaker and taking his or her ideas seriously.

-  Before discussion, ask students to reflect on a directed, yet open,  question in a five- to ten-minute writing. Encourage students to keep writing throughout the allotted time even if they run out of things to say. They will surprise themselves with this unstructured writing. This writing is not a quiz with one correct answer. Ask them questions such as “What do you think is the significance of X?”; “How has X changed over time?”; “Why did X dowhat he or she did?” You could also ask them to do a close reading of a particular passage, perhaps even comparing it to another passage.

-  Avoid general questions such as “What did you think of the reading for today?” or “What did you find interesting?” These can be dead-end questions that will lead to short discussions.

-  To mix things up, you may also have them work together in small groups to find discussion starters or answers to your questions.

**Other ideas and approaches:**

-  Different classes have different personalities. Just make sure the environment in which students speak is a safe one, and continue to encourage discussion in different ways if something is not working.

-  Some students will direct their comments just to you. Encourage them to talk with each other.

-  If you had them write a response, invite students to share what they wrote.

-  If you had them work in groups, invite representatives from each group to share what they found.

-  Encourage students to point to specifics in the text. Ask them where they see what they see.

-  Invite students to read sections out loud.

-  Be open to where the conversation takes you. Sometimes students will pick up on details that you didn't see.

-  Try not to let the class discussion go over fifteen to twenty minutes. Students are most productive in that time frame.

-  At the end of the discussion, recap the major points made or ask students to do so.

-  Course-specific discussion prompts are included in the course-specific sections of this guide.

How do I deal with controversial topics?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some issues in *Callings* may spark controversy in the classroom. Issues
that may generate controversy include but are not limited to gender
discrimination, mental health, and same-sex marriage. The Yale Poorvu
Center for Teaching and Learning's `Teaching Controversial
Topics <http://ctl.yale.edu/teaching/ideas-teaching/teaching-controversial-topics>`__
can help you consider different approaches to discussing these issues.

Remember that the common read discussion should always serve your course
outcomes. If a student raises an issue with which you have no expertise
or are uncomfortable tackling, you might respond by explaining the topic
is more suited for discussion in a different course (such as English,
Sociology, or Political Science). For example, you might say,
“[Controversy X] is an important issue, and it's one that you can study
in depth in [Course Y]. [Course Y] is taught by an expert in that field.
For the purposes of this course, let's keep the focus on [your course
outcome Z].” Additional guidelines are below.

If a student raises a controversial issue unexpectedly, you may want to:

   1. Acknowledge the student's remark.

   2. Acknowledge that other students may hold different views or positions.
   
   3. Assess your willingness to continue the discussion further.

   4. Assess other students' willingness to continue the discussion further.

The following guidelines may be helpful for facilitating planned
discussions of controversial issues:

   1. Articulate a clear purpose for the discussion (for example,
   how the discussion is related to course objectives).

   2. Establish ground rules, such as listening without interrupting
   the speaker, questioning ideas rather than criticizing individuals,
   offering at least one piece of evidence to support each point made,
   using “I” statements rather than “you” statements.

   3. Be an active facilitator by redirecting students who are off
   topic or participating too actively, ensuring students are not put on
   the spot as spokespersons for certain groups, providing opportunities
   for all students to participate (orally or through writing), and
   being attuned to students' emotions.

   4. Summarize the discussion at the end of class and obtain
   student feedback.

How do I build instruction around the stories' themes?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The stories capture many themes: formal vs. informal education,
happiness, work-life balance, friendship, family, mental health, money,
wellbeing, and others.

1. A class focusing on the theme of formal vs. informal education might
   look like this:

   a. Individually, students identify and write about a passage that examines formal and/or informal education. (five to seven minutes)

   b. As a class, students discuss the passages they have chosen. (ten to fifteen minutes)

   c. With partners, students list why formal and/or informal education is essential for a certain job/career and why this matters in a larger context. (five to ten minutes)

   d. Student pairs report their findings to the entire class. (ten to fifteen minutes)

   e. Homework: Students write a personal reflection on how formal and/or informal education will play important roles in the pursuit of their desired jobs/careers, perhaps examining why a college degree (or degrees) is or is not required for the positions or related positions they are interested in pursuing.

students to attend an event and reflect on the overall message being
delivered. For the most up-to-date list, visit the `UM Common Reading
Experience 2023 Callings Library
Guide. <https://guides.lib.olemiss.edu/c.php?g=1331284&p=9804178>`__

What if one of my students has a disability and needs a copy of the book in a different format?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Students with disabilities should visit Student Disability Services in
234 Martindale as soon as possible at the beginning of the semester. SDS
provides classroom accommodations to all students on campus who disclose
a disability, request accommodations, and meet eligibility requirements.
SDS will be able to help your student acquire a copy of the CRE book in
an appropriate format. The SDS website,
https://sds.olemiss.edu/faculty/, has some helpful resources for
instructors.

*Callings* Critical Thinking Exercises
-------------------------------------------------

The UM QEP, Think Forward, defines critical thinking as the ability to conceptualize problems, gather pertinent information, interpret data, appraise evidence, distinguish diverse points of view, and articulate personal insights in order to present reasonable and effective arguments, responses, or conclusions.

    .. image:: /assets/qep.png
        :align: center
        :alt: Diagram of the Think Forward QEP Learning outcomes


**These small group exercises may help students develop critical
thinking skills.**

(1) Barbara Abelhauser says she took a pay cut to go to a job she loves,
being a bridgetender, and leave behind a job where she was “miserable”
(17-21). Many people have to weigh pay vs. happiness when considering
work. Why do you think this is an either-or scenario for so many people?
In small groups, discuss careers you are considering, and then research
salaries for those careers and possibly related ones (consider sites
such as the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics at
https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_nat.htm). How much can people expect
to make as beginners in the positions you looked at? What is the typical
pay range? Does it meet your expectations? Research information on how
happy people are in that line of work. Do the results meet your
expectations? How so or not? Consider the particular career paths you
researched, potentially including related careers/jobs, and then discuss
the results as a group. You might also discuss areas such as benefits,
travel expectations, balancing work with a family, etc. Finally, make an
argument as a group about how people might best balance the type of pay
they seek with the happiness level they expect and why such balance is
meaningful.

(2) Several women featured in *Callings* overcame gender barriers to
reach their career/job goals. Anne Lucietto's father Ledo says people
asked him, “What do you want to send her to college for? She's only a
girl. They're only good for making babies” (66). Anne went on to become
a mechanical engineer. Dr. Dorothy Warburton explains that her own
father couldn't see her in science (43-4), yet she became a leading
genetic researcher. Why are women still so underrepresented in STEM
(science, technology, engineering, and math) fields? In small groups,
discuss Lucietto, Warburton, and/or any other women from *Callings* who
had to fight through gender barriers. Also, do some research in places
such as the American Association of University Women website:
https://www.aauw.org/resources/research/the-stem-gap/. What can we do in
America to make sure more women are in STEM jobs? Each group should make
an argument about why the numbers of women in STEM fields are what they
are today and what might occur if the numbers become more balanced.

(3) In the introduction to *Callings*, Isay says, “Listening has always
been at the heart of StoryCorps' mission” (3). Watch the TED Talk, “\ `5
Ways to Listen
Better <https://www.ted.com/talks/julian_treasure_5_ways_to_listen_better?utm_campaign=tedspread&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=tedcomshare>`__,”
by author and sound consultant Julian Treasure. Discuss Treasure's
contention that we are losing our ability to listen well. Then divide
students into pairs or small groups to practice Treasure's mixer
exercise. Ask them to leave the classroom and find a place, inside or
out, to sit together. Groups should remain at their chosen locations for
5-10 minutes, with each group member listing the channels of sound they
hear. Then group members should compare notes, making a master list of
all the sound channels they heard. Groups should then return to class to
share their results and consider how those channels affected their
environments. Following the sharing, discuss the channels operating in
other environments, like the classroom. How do these channels (students
whispering to one another, students watching online videos, students
listening through headphones to something else, etc.) affect the
classroom experience? What about the channels operating in the dorms? On
the Square?

(4) Use this exercise, adapted from `StoryCorps
Lessons <https://storycorps.org/discover/education/lesson-the-power-of-active-listening/>`__,
to encourage students to consider and practice the role of wait time in
active listening.

-  Display and discuss author Diana Senechal's quote: “Listening . . . involves a certain surrender, a willingness to sit with what one does not already know . . . [it] requires us to stretch a little beyond what we know, expect, or want.”

-  Ask students to interview each other, using the following prompt: 
  
   *Who has been the most important person in your life?* 

   As they interview each other, they will practice using short silences.
   Whenever the interviewee stops speaking, the interviewer should
   pause for six to eight seconds (counting quietly to themselves)
   before asking a follow-up question. During this silence, the
   interviewee is free to add any details to their story. The
   interviewer will then need to wait for another opportunity to ask
   a follow-up question. Each interview should last five minutes.

-  Following the interviews, bring the class back together to discuss the following questions: 
   How did it feel to pause before the follow-up question?  
   Do you think people generally use these short silences in real life conversations?  
   What does it feel like when someone interrupts you? Why do people interrupt? 

CRE Community of Voices Essay 
-----------------------------------------

**An Essay Challenge Connecting Diverse Ideas, Experiences, Disciplines,
and People**

The Creed characterizes the University of Mississippi as “a community of
learning dedicated to nurturing excellence in intellectual inquiry and
personal character in an open and diverse environment.” As part of that
mission, the UM Common Reading Experience helps students develop a sense
of community among diverse peers, neighbors, and instructors, while
making connections across varied ideas, experiences, and disciplines.
The CRE Diverse Voices Essay Challenge provides an opportunity for
students to further engage with that mission by examining issues related
to the common book. Below are challenge and submission details:

-  The annual challenge is open to all UM undergraduate students.

-  One winner and two finalists will be chosen by a panel of judges.

-  The winner will receive $400.

**Fall 2023 Prompt**

In Dave Isay's 2016 book *Callings*, he presents stories of people
describing the career paths they chose to pursue, their inspirations for
choosing those paths, and the connections to their communities created
through their work. The book is part of the StoryCorps project, whose
mission is to “preserve and share humanity's stories in order to build
connections between people and create a more just and compassionate
world.” Our UM community is also built from these connections shared
among students who are pursuing their callings, and like the people in
Isay's book, the diversity of those stories creates a vibrant portrait
of our students' lived experiences. For this year's Community of Voices
essay contest, we want to hear your stories. What calling are you
pursuing? What inspired you to follow that path? What challenges have
you faced along the way, and how have you worked to overcome those
challenges? Why is your calling important, and how do you plan to use it
to connect to your community both now and in your future? Consider these
questions and write a personal narrative that tells the story of your
own calling.

While the Common Read is a text provided to incoming first-year
students, we encourage participation from all UM undergraduate students.
The following links lead to some of the recorded interviews that are
included in *Callings*. Each recording is around two minutes. Students
who don't have access to the book might consider listening to some of
these stories on the StoryCorps site for inspiration. Note, though, that
the recordings are interviews and not essays. Use them for inspiration
to think about your own story, but present your work as a narrative
essay for the contest. For more links to the interviews behind the
essays, use the `UM Common Reading Experience Library
Guide. <https://guides.lib.olemiss.edu/cre2023>`__

Integrating *Callings* into EDHE 105/305
---------------------------------------------------

The Common Reading Text is used each year in EDHE 105/305 courses
primarily as a framework for class discussions, projects, and writing
assignments that explore social themes and/or issues from the book. EDHE
105/305 instructors use the book (with a focus on those themes and
issues) to teach students how to explore their personal reactions, to
understand and appreciate both the things that make them different from
their peers and the things that they have in common, and to effectively
and respectfully voice their own opinions and viewpoints.

Affordances of *Callings*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The short story structure of *Callings* affords instructors and students
some options previous Common Reading Texts have not. Most of the stories
are short enough to be read in the first ten-fifteen minutes of class.
Also, each story can stand independently from the others, so each can be
treated as a primary text.

**Class Discussion/Writing Prompts** 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1.	Dave Isay’s Callings is about finding and living your passion. Think about your major and your aspirations for after college. Do they inspire the passion that we find in the stories we have read?
2.	Library Assistant Storm Reyes talks about a chance encounter with a bookmobile staff member that set her on her path to loving books, which ultimately broadened her view of the world. Reflect on an interaction you’ve had with someone who turned out to be pivotal in changing your perspective or view of the world. 
3.	Bridgetender Barbara Abelhauser discusses leaving the corporate job that she was miserable in to go to the lower paying but more Zen-like job of bridgetending. What are some of the pros and cons of choosing happiness over monetary compensation?
4.	Tool and Die Maker Phil Kerner reflects on the difficulty of losing his business and talks about how it inspired him to start an organization to help small businesses. Think about a time in your life where you had to face a “crushing” disappointment. How did you respond to it? Were you able to find a way to use the experience for growth?
5.	Farmer Johnny Bradley remembers his father saying, “Son, you can’t whip a man that don’t quit.” Think about a time when you persevered through adversity; share the situation and the outcome. 
6.	Street-corner astronomer Herman Heyn was inspired by “Miss Wicker’s class” to share his love of astronomy. Think back on the interactions you have had in your life; write/discuss how a teacher may have influenced your life’s direction.
7.	Angelo Bruno and Eddie Nieves were the sanitation workers who found a great partnership in helping their community. Think about the ways the people around you can help fuel your ability to find your calling.
8.	Beekeeper Ted Dennard talks about being totally in the moment when he’s working with his bees. What is an activity or pursuit that keeps you completely engaged? Reflect on what you experience through your various senses “in the moment.” 
9.	Marc Anderson Lawson discusses his video game inventor father with his sister. When he decided to go to college, he said to himself, “What could I do for a living that I would want to do for free?” He decided to do programming, like his father. If asked that question, how would you answer?
10.	Building contractor Lyle Link talks about how successes don’t teach you much, but mistakes are learning situations. In college you’ll encounter both successes and failures. Think back on your life; what is a mistake you learned more from than you did from any of your successes?


GROUP/INDIVIDUAL PROJECT ASSIGNMENTS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1.	Research Project/Presentation: Think about your own calling. Interview a person who is in that field. Ask them about their pathway to finding their calling. Present your findings to the class.
2.	Research Project/Presentation: Create a PowerPoint presentation on the career of your choice. Include pertinent information, such as salary, education requirements, nature of the work, working conditions, occupational outlook, and pros/cons of the career. 


3. **Talk Response**: *Callings* (*StoryCorps*) is also a podcast that can be found on all major podcast platforms. Go to the `StoryCorps website <https://storycorps.org/>`__ and search for your favorite story by the person's name. While the written word can be very powerful, think about how you feel after you listen to the podcast in their own words. Links to the stories in each chapter of the book are available for your convenience on the `UM Common Reading Experience Library   Guide. <https://guides.lib.olemiss.edu/cre2023>`__

4. Vignette Writing Assignment: All of the stories in Callings connect humans to their passion. Think about your life at the University of Mississippi and how you will be able to connect with your future self as you find your passion. How do you see yourself in five, ten, and/or fifteen years? Write a vignette (experience) about your future self in the midst of your own calling.

5. **Outside-of-Class Activity**: Choose a `Career Fair <https://career.olemiss.edu/career-fairs/>`__ that piques your interest and attend. Write a reflection on your attendance and interactions.
   
6. Research Project/Presentation: Write an aspirational resume that will help you realize what you should be striving for with regard to skills for the job you aspire to attain.
   
Integrating *Callings* into WRIT 100/101
---------------------------------------------------

The first-semester, first-year writing courses—WRIT 100 and WRIT 101—use
the Common Reading Text as the basis for a major writing project. This
project emphasizes the critical reading, critical thinking, analysis,
research, and synthesis skills that are vital to college writing. In
this assignment, students are given a prompt pertaining to the Common
Reading Text and asked to compose an essay that integrates the Common
Reading Text with the student's own ideas and perhaps outside sources.
The prompts are intentionally complex to introduce students to the
expectations of college thinking and writing. First-year writing courses
use the Common Reading Text as a basis for student reading and writing
rather than as a literary study.

Discussion Starters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

(1) Some people learn early in life what their passions, or callings,
are. Lee Buono, for example, was encouraged by his eighth grade science
teacher, Al Siedlecki, and knew he wanted to be a neurosurgeon (177-81).
What are the advantages and disadvantages to being sure of your
passion/calling at a young age? How does school, in particular, college,
help or muddle people's pursuit of their passions/callings? Why does
this matter?

(2) Ricardo Pitts-Wiley, an actor, says about talent, “you only get a
portion of the gift, and if you're patient, the rest of it will come”
(95). What does Pitts-Wiley mean by this statement? Do you agree with
him? Is being “patient” the way to maximize a talent? Why or why not?

(3) In her 2018 commencement address to the Annenberg School of
Communication and Journalism, Oprah Winfrey shared this career advice:
“Your job is not always going to fulfill you. There will be some days
that you just might be bored. Other days, you may not feel like going to
work at all—go anyway.” Choose a few of the stories you have read in
*Callings*, and consider when or how those jobs might be boring or
unfulfilling. How do you imagine people cope with the less engaging
parts of their work? What keeps them moving forward despite boredom or
fatigue?

(4) The subtitle to *Callings* is *The Purpose and Passion of Work*. As
a class, read or listen to Samantha Todd Ryan's *Forbes* article,
“\ `The ‘Why' Behind Our Work: What Is ‘Purpose' and Do We Need
It? <https://www.forbes.com/sites/samanthatodd/2019/07/29/the-why-behind-our-work-what-is-purpose-and-do-we-need-it/?sh=3f6b15851265>`__\ ”
Then, discuss what purpose means. Can you agree on a definition? If not,
why? Borrowing from the question in the article title, do we need
purpose in our work? Why or why not?

(5) Introductions and conclusions are hard to write. Look at the opening
and closing of your favorite story. What techniques does the storyteller
use to draw the reader in? What techniques help bring the story to a
graceful close?

(6) *Callings* is broken into five sections: Dreamers, Generations,
Healers, Philosophers, and Groundbreakers. Some of the stories, though,
seem like they could be classified under different sections. Discuss the
stories in *Callings* and select one you feel is in the wrong section or
at least could be in a different section. Why does or could the story
fit somewhere else? Where should it or could it go? Should the book even
feature sections? Why or why not? Why do we feel the need to label or
categorize so much? How is it helpful? How is it limiting?

(7) Isay ends his introduction with the line, “May their words help give
you the strength to listen to that still, small voice inside—that voice
which can help you discover the work that you were born to do.” Discuss
the idea that we are each born to do a certain type of work. Is that
thought limiting or inspiring? Would the individuals featured in the
stories all agree they were born to do the work they are doing?

Reflection Prompts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

(1) Herman Heyn, a street-corner astronomer whose story is featured on
pages 11-16, says he was inspired by his grade school teacher Miss
Wicker. Reflect on who inspired a particular interest for learning in
you. Have you told that person? If so, how did that make you feel? If
not, what would you say to them now if you could? Why?

(2) *Callings* features short excerpts from interviews and includes a
picture of the people at the end of each story. Reflect on how the
photos impacted your reading process. Why do you think they are
included? Do they make you think differently about the people you just
read about when you see them at the end? Why or why not? Did you always
wait until the end of each story to look at the picture? Why or why not?

(3) Some of the stories in *Callings* feature people who are in their
70s—some even beyond that—well past the average retirement age in
America. Why do you think these people still work? Reflect on whether
these stories make you think more about your choice for a future career
or future careers. Why do they or don't they?

(4) In the “Introduction” to *Callings*, Dave Isay quotes author and
activist Parker Palmer when he writes, “Before you tell your life what
you intend to do with it, listen for what it intends to do with you.”
Reflect on how you might take this advice as a student new to college.
What opportunities might college provide to help you “listen to your
life”? Why does listening to your life matter in the bigger picture?

(5) Sharon Long, a forensic artist, says that she can get lost in her
work, forgetting about everything else for hours. Reflect on what type
of work or activity makes you lose track of time. Why? What does this
tell you about yourself and what you might like to do for a career/job?

(6) When library assistant Storm Reyes was a little girl she visited a
bookmobile at the farm fields where her migrant family worked. During
one visit to the bookmobile, the person working told her “the more you
know about something, the less you will fear it” (41). Reflect on what
this means when applied to work. Does this mean we should follow a
career/job path in something familiar? Does this mean we should not be
afraid to chase dream careers/jobs? What does it mean to you, and why?

(7) *Callings* features dozens of short stories about work, some of
which feature people who went into their line of work because of
something important that happened to them in their childhood or teenage
years. Reflect on something from your childhood or teenage years that
has helped shape your career/job goals. What and/or who helped shape
you? Why was this meaningful? Did your approach to academics change in
any ways afterward? If so, how? If not, why?

(8) When Noramay Cadena was at M.I.T. she managed school and having a
young daughter by focusing on one week at a time and telling herself
“next week will be better” (79). Cadena knew that graduating was the one
thing that could help her and her family the most. Reflect on your own
approaches to getting through difficult times in school. Do you have
something that you do or tell yourself to help stay focused? If so,
what, and why does it help? If not, why, and is that something that
might be valuable to you in college?

(9) Some of the people featured in *Callings* followed in the footsteps
of a parent or parents for their careers/jobs. Reflect on the influence
your parents, or other close relatives, have had on your thoughts about
future careers/jobs. Have you been heavily influenced by family or not?
Whatever your answer, what impact has this had on your choices and why?

(10) In a review of *Callings* for NACADA, the Global Community for
Academic Advising, Ashley Wegener writes that a “theme present
throughout the book was the importance of mentors in providing
accountability, support, and inspiration for callings.” Reflect on the
role of mentors in your life. What does the word “mentor” mean to you?
Do you have a mentor? If so, who, and how does this person help you? If
not, why, and do you have someone who might serve as a mentor? Why is
college an important time to have or consider having a mentor? Are
mentors people who just help with areas such as school or careers/jobs?
Why or why not?

(11) In one of the stories in *Callings*, firefighter Dekalb Walcott Jr.
says of his career aspirations, “you shoot for the stars, and if you
land somewhere in between, you're still in good shape” (55). Reflect on
your preparedness to handle changes or even setbacks if college or your
plans beyond college don't go exactly as you thought they would. Do you
need to accomplish all of your goals to be truly happy? Why or why not?
What do you think Walcott Jr. means when he uses the words “land
somewhere in between” and “good shape”? What would that mean for you?

(12) StoryCorps' website includes this statement: “At StoryCorps, we
know the power of one great question. When we sit down face to face, ask
to hear someone's truth, and listen to it, we begin to recognize where
our lives intersect.” Reflect on a moment of “intersection” that you
felt when you read one of the stories in *Callings*. What was that
connection like for you? Why do you think it resonated?

Essay Prompts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

(1) In the “Author's Note” section, Dave Isay points out that “[w]ords
and phrases that read well are not always the strongest spoken moments,
and the reverse is also the case.” Many of the stories in *Callings* are
available as audio recordings on
`storycorps.org <https://storycorps.org/>`__ (enter an interviewee's
name on the top of the page using the “Search” feature). You can also
find some of them in the `UM Common Reading Experience Library
Guide <https://guides.lib.olemiss.edu/cre2023>`__. Select one story to
work with that is available on audio, and listen to the recording a
couple of times. Then, compose a thesis-driven essay in which you
analyze the differences between the written and spoken story, arguing
which is more rhetorically effective to you and why. Think about the
differences rhetorically, that is, how the different formats work to
reach you and other readers or listeners. Is one more emotionally
impactful? If so, why? Do the editing differences between the audio
recording and the written story impact the experiences in any ways? If
so, how? To Isay's point, are there words or phrases in either the
recording or the story that are stronger or more clear in one form over
the other? If so, why? How does hearing the voices in the interview
differ from reading their words, and why does that matter in considering
the subject matter? Be sure to cite from the text and the interview.

(2) In his story, Lyle Link reflects back on being a contractor and says
that he was essentially a “salesman” (256). Really, a lot of jobs that
aren't classified as sales involve being a salesperson in some way(s).
Why is this? Select two other stories from *Callings* to work with, and
examine how the people are selling something in one form or another.
Keep in mind that you might be liberal with your definition of sales.
Then, compose a thesis-driven essay in which you define how you are
using the term “sales” or “salesperson,” and examine how you see your
chosen subjects as being salespeople. You might construct a thesis that
lets you contrast your subjects or focus on similarities, or perhaps
some combination. Be sure to cite from the text.

(3) Sharon Long says of her field, forensic artistry, that now “they
have state-of-the-art equipment” (25) and that “technology is moving so
fast” that she would be left behind if she were to keep working. What
roles might technology and artificial intelligence play in the
careers/jobs people currently hold? Select two other stories from
*Callings* for a focus, and examine how AI or technology in general
might impact the fields in the future. Will humans still be necessary
for these positions? If so, will it be in the same ways as in the past?
Do you see the technology having a positive or negative impact on the
positions? Do the stories you selected contain any information that
helps you shape your argument? Consider doing a little research to help
you, and then compose a thesis-driven essay in which you argue how
technology will impact your chosen positions in the coming years. You
are welcome to bring in outside sources, but be sure to cite *Callings*,
as well.

(4) Read the StoryCorps mission statement below:

   StoryCorps' mission is to preserve and share humanity's stories in
   order to build connections between people and create a more just and
   compassionate world. We do this to remind one another of our shared
   humanity, to strengthen and build the connections between people, to
   teach the value of listening, and to weave into the fabric of our
   culture the understanding that everyone's story matters. At the same
   time, we are creating an invaluable archive for future generations.
   -- About StoryCorps, storycorps.org

How can reading about the work some people do help “strengthen and build
the connections between people”? Why does “everyone's story” matter?
Think about StoryCorps' mission statement, and consider the different
stories in *Callings*. Then, select two stories to focus on. Why should
we care about what your chosen subjects have to say? What do they help
us understand about humanity? How do they make us or help us think about
being “more just and compassionate”? What does reading these stories
teach us about listening? And why does this matter in relation to
StoryCorps' mission statement? Why is compiling an “archive for future
generations” important? Construct a thesis-driven essay in which you
argue how the stories and people you chose exemplify and help perpetuate
StoryCorps' mission statement. Be sure to cite from the text.

(5) Read Jeremy Hsu's *Scientific American* article, “\ `The Secrets of
Storytelling: Why We Love a Good
Yarn <https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-secrets-of-storytelling/>`__,”
paying particular attention to his discussion of narrative transport
factors (familiarity, empathy, learning, and social cohesion). Choose
two or three stories in *Callings* that appeal to you and apply those
narrative transport factors to your experience in reading the stories.
Construct a thesis-driven essay analyzing how these factors affected
your experience as a reader of these stories. Be sure to include
evidence from Hsu's article and from the *Callings* stories to support
your argument.

(6) Read “\ `Speaking my truth: Why personal experiences can bridge
divides but
mislead <https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2100280118>`__,”Van Bavel
et al.'s commentary in *PNAS* (Proceedings of the National Academy of
Sciences). Consider their argument that stories of personal experience
can help readers engage with outgroups, build respect, and humanize
marginalized individuals. Choose one or two *Callings* stories featuring
individuals whom you perceive as very different from you. How did these
stories help you understand these individuals in new and positive ways?
Which of the factors that Van Bavel et al. covered were in play? Then
consider Van Bavel et al.'s point that stories of personal experience
can be exploited. How might the stories you have chosen be subject to
exploitation in larger cultural conversations about income inequality,
fair labor practices, gender or racial stereotyping, etc.? Construct a
thesis-driven essay in which you analyze how the stories you have chosen
may bridge divides but also mislead. Be sure to include evidence from
the *PNAS* article as well as the *Callings* stories to support your
analysis.

(7) The stories in *Callings* paint a portrait of work as fulfilling and
life-enriching. Is that how everyone views work? Watch Gallup's “\ `The
State of the Global Workplace 2022
Report <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZ48l9OQIZ8>`__\ ” and download
the
`report <https://www.gallup.com/workplace/349484/state-of-the-global-workplace.aspx?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=gallup_access_branded&utm_term=gallup%20employee%20engagement&gclid=CjwKCAjwvdajB>`__.
Pay particular attention to the key findings on global
engagement/well-being and employee stress. Think about how the stories
in *Callings* address those issues. Construct a thesis-driven argument
about how and why workplace leaders should or should not address these
issues, using evidence from the Gallup report and the first-hand
accounts in *Callings*.

(8) In an *Oral History Review* article, “\ `Under Storytelling's Spell?
Oral History in a Neoliberal
Age <https://www-tandfonline-com.umiss.idm.oclc.org/doi/epdf/10.1093/ohr/ohv002?needAccess=true&role=button>`__,”Alexander
Freund cautions against conflating storytelling and history, arguing our
current fascination with storytelling is rooted in neoliberalism,
hyperindividualism, and therapy culture. Read Freund's article and think
about the stories in *Callings*. Construct a thesis-driven argument
agreeing with or refuting Freund's case, using the stories in *Callings*
as evidence.

(9) Read Simone Stolzoff's essay, “\ `Please Don't Call My Job a
Calling <https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/05/opinion/employment-exploitation-unions.html?unlocked_article_code=9hpU9k3pdB-XkYLzc0yC3TjWA90YKc3D0iceG0rfuu7HVzDpzWCUNGTpbQBS7wqmZ__rugHbgJQzRNhH07aXF6phwBatQxK0S6-UT5quIzrbscMji_0fx9WTwaKkNqHSzQ0zeTCV1Vn7fo8TBSHRs3qUM8bDtNRpPb3FvhMNDJdCk5tcPR-NWM5TD_9q2JRRgsapT0DHdXFFaVHpicZsncV8HCpOIIycYdWweZv_x46HlpJooCKtefrBxmoAXnO3swghXvy3oYw16uM70xfiyFUR0Gs8kz6bG8-tk2pFkGmE4G-alWg7Q8rOm6OAlbEItI49vIWU8ajr2RyhOrnAOYDckLzQRL0H&smid=url-share>`__,”
in *The New York Times* and his *Forbes* interview, “\ `Understanding
What is the Good Enough
Job <https://www.forbes.com/sites/goldiechan/2023/05/23/understanding-what-is-the-good-enough-job-with-author-simone-stolzoff/?sh=653e82432150>`__.”
Think about his arguments that the term “calling” can lead to worker
exploitation and that work-centric lives may not be healthy. Then think
about *Callings* as a complete text. In what ways does the book
intrinsically or extrinsically foster worker exploitation and
work-centric lives? In what ways does it not? Compose a thesis-driven
argument supporting or refuting Stolzoff's argument, using evidence from
*Callings* to shore up your points.

(10) *Multimodal option*: For this assignment, you will create your own
story like the ones featured in *Callings*. The process should help with
skills such as interviewing and writing interview questions, editing
through making rhetorical choices about content, and thinking critically
about different forms of media.

- First, you will decide on a subject to interview. The person you select should be someone whose career/job is interesting to you and something you would like to learn more about. Whom you interview is entirely up to you.
- Write a series of interview questions that will get your interviewee talking about their career/job. These questions may range from origin stories (how the person became interested in or got into the career/job) to questions about the day-to-day work to questions about how the work is rewarding and fulfilling.
- Obtain permission from the interviewee to record and edit the interview for your assignment purposes.
- Interview the subject, ideally recording at least ten minutes of material either through video/audio or just audio. 
- Edit the interview so your final product is between three-five minutes in length (editing should cut down the length of the project, not change meaning).
- Make sure the interviewee is the focus of the final product (i.e., even if you are part of the final product asking questions or participating in small ways, the interviewee should be the one mainly featured).
- Submit the final product as an audio file or a video using approved file forms or platforms.


Remember, the subtitle of *Callings* is *The Purpose and Passion of
Work*, so your goal should be to interview someone who enjoys their work
and/or feels fulfilled. An interview featuring a subject complaining a
lot about a job wouldn't fit well in *Callings*, so it won't work well
for this assignment either.
