Course Design
-------------

Writing 100/101 is designed as an introductory course to academic
writing featuring genres commonly used in other academic situations such
as analysis, argument, and reflection. Students choose to take either
Writing 100 or Writing 101 and then move into Writing 102 or Liberal
Arts 102 after successful completion of either course; they are not
placed into either course by test score or writing sample.

Suggested Assignment Sequence
-----------------------------

The suggested assignment sequence is as follows: Common Reading Text
project, Analysis, Argument, Multimodal, Commonplace Book. The Common
Reading Text project emphasizes the critical reading, critical thinking,
analysis, research, and synthesis skills that are vital to college
writing. This project is the ideal starting point because the assignment
is based on the Common Reading Text, which students are given over the
summer. With related campus events, the Common Reading Text can help
teachers establish a community of readers and writers. The next project,
the Analysis, helps students build the critical thinking skills they
need to write analytically in many of the other assignments, both in
Writing 100/101 and across the university. The Argument strengthens
students’ research skills by asking them to work with outside sources
and utilize the University library. The Multimodal project, which is a
sort of revision or rethinking of a previous paper, takes place later in
the semester. The Commonplace Book is an ongoing, semester-long project
that requires students to reflect on their learning and writing
practices.

Major Projects
--------------

Students are expected to complete five major units, each of which
comprises critical reading and response, a drafting process, and
reflection. In at least three of the units, students should be assigned
a short timed-writing exercise as part of the writing process. A brief
overview of each project, with a description of the areas students
usually struggle with, is provided below. (Click the arrow next to the
project title to expand).

Common Reading Text Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Common Reading Text project emphasizes the critical reading,
critical thinking, analysis, research, and synthesis skills that are
vital to college writing. Students respond to one of the prompts
included in the annual Common Reading Resource Guide.

.. admonition:: Areas to Highlight

    Some students may not have read or finished the
    source text and will benefit from a pre-semester reminder to read the
    book. They may have limited experience with reading/interpreting a
    writing prompt. Students will have varied experience in analysis and
    argument, and most will have little experience with synthesizing
    texts/voices. Students may also not be familiar with extensive drafting
    and the rigor of college expectations. The Common Reading Text Project
    is roughly a two and one-half week unit.

Analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In analysis, students examine an issue or an artifact’s component parts
to understand how they work together to make meaning. Analysis is roughly a three-week
unit.

.. admonition:: Areas to Highlight

    Many students don’t have much experience with
    analysis and often have difficulty moving past summary. Some are
    unaccustomed to examining individual parts of an issue or an artifact
    and may need guidance in breaking down the whole. Often, students
    struggle with identifying an analytic thesis that answers the questions
    how, why, and/or so what. Once students have a draft in place, the most
    common problems are organization and focus. It is not uncommon for a
    student to try to cover many different ideas. These writers need help
    organizing their thoughts and focusing their essays. Students sometimes
    struggle with providing enough specific evidence to support their
    analyses. These writers may need to be alerted to areas that would
    benefit from additional evidence.

Argument
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In argument, students make a claim and support that claim with evidence.
While instructors may assign for this project different types of
argument, the essay should require background information on the topic
as context for the argument, a clearly-expressed main claim, evidence,
and consideration of counter-arguments. Argument is a three- to four-week
unit.

.. admonition:: Areas to Highlight

    Students often need help narrowing a topic to a
    specific, debatable claim. Some students struggle to provide enough
    specific evidence to support their claims and need help locating and
    evaluating sources. Students often need help integrating quoted material
    and paraphrases into their texts as well as documenting their sources.
    Students may also need help considering opposing viewpoints or
    counterarguments and refutation.

Multimodal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In the multimodal assignment, students may rework or rethink an earlier
project in a different mode or medium. Multimodal is roughly a two-week
project.

.. admonition:: Areas to Highlight

    Students often don’t recognize that a change in mode
    or medium requires a change in technique, so they need help in
    understanding how electronic, visual, or spoken text is different from
    print text and, thus, how to think about audience. Students may also
    need help with unfamiliar technology.

Reflection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Students will reflect on their writing and learning throughout the semsester. This 
may involve daily, weekly, and unit reflections, culminating in a final reflection.

.. admonition:: Areas to Highlight

    Students are generally unfamiliar with
    self-reflection and metacognition and need many opportunities throughout
    the semester to practice. Many will need help with being more specific
    about their learning. Students may have difficulty demonstrating their
    progress, or lack thereof, through examples, often resorting to more
    telling than showing. Students may also struggle to understand how
    tagging can be a mechanism to represent the larger structures of their
    learning.

--------------

Grading
-------
Rubrics for each project are available on the assignment library.
Sharing the rubric with students at the beginning of each unit, and
using the rubric to determine the project’s final grade, helps students
understand the expectations for each project and the reasons for the
final grade. Using the rubric to determine grades also provides
consistency across sections of DWR courses. Projects should be graded
and returned within one week of submission.
