<h3>Servers<a class="headerlink" href="#servers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>At present, the department maintains four QNAP-brand NAS servers to support onsite backup of mission-critical administrator computers. Three of these units, designated dwrstorage02.cwr.olemiss.edu, dwrstorage03.cwr.olemiss.edu, and dwrpool04.cwr.olemiss.edu are housed in office B23 of Lamar Hall. 02 and 04 support LAN-based Time Machine backups of department administrators’ computers which are running macOS, while 03 supports various LAN-based backup and document history modes of department administrators’ computers which are running Windows 10. All three of these servers are backed up daily in bulk to the WAN-based fourth server, dwrarchive06.cwr.olemiss.edu, which is located across campus in the Data Center.</p>
<p>As they host file-level backups of administrators’ computers, these servers are assumed to contain sensitive data on students and employees and are registered as such with IT. Accordingly, all four are all password-protected and access-restricted to the specific reserved IP address range of the department’s dedicated wired subnet at 130.74.44.xxx/25, plus the specific individual Cisco VPN IP addresses assigned to the assessment coordinator, the instructional designer, and the communications specialist for off-campus access by those employees specifically to facilitate remote management as needed.</p>
<p>In addition to the computer-supporting backup servers, the department maintains a dedicated QNAP-brand NAS server to support the in-classroom recording technology installed in Lamar Hall room 413, designated dwrmulti09.cwr.olemiss.edu and also physically located in office B23. This server contains local copies of student speech deliveries recorded in the aforementioned classroom, and as such, is subject to FERPA considerations due to the enrollment information a video recording can incidentally contain. This system is therefore also registered, password-protected, and IP-address-restricted, as above. The recordings stored on this system are backed up to non-public folders on Google Drive for assessment purposes. Those folders are only shared with the relevant instructors engaged in assessment or grading activity.</p>
<p>Lastly, the department maintains a Linux-based server on an Intel box in office B22 to support the digital signage installed throughout in Lamar Hall as well as various other public-facing academic projects: dwrweb08.cwr.olemiss.edu. This server contains no sensitive information, but is password-protected and IP-address-restricted for good measure anyway.</p>
<p>The department has an annual contract with CampusPress to deploy and support that vendor’s managed WordPress installation for education, Edublogs, at the remote-hosted, SSO-integrated domain edblogs.olemiss.edu. As part of the original RFP, the vendor certifies this system as being FERPA-compliant. This system is used by students (and increasing numbers of faculty) for building websites as part of coursework (or professional activities). Privacy settings and access control for student websites under this system are configured for non-public availability by default, and require permission of both the student and the instructor before content may be made public.</p>

<div class="section" id="cloud-storage-devices">
<h3>Cloud Storage Devices<a class="headerlink" href="#cloud-storage-devices" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>All official departmental electronic records not kept exclusively in SAP or email are stored permanently in Box. This specifically includes records containing sensitive information. Access permissions to various parts of the relevant folder hierarchies are reviewed at least annually, and upon employment status changes of any department personnel who would need access to such files. Box is also widely used throughout the department for individual or collaborative storage of, and access to, non-sensitive files of various kinds.</p>
<p>Previously, some of the department official records material was stored in Google Drive. Although migration of department files to Box is complete, some faculty and staff are continuing to use Google Drive for other professional and personal purposes, both individually and collaboratively.</p>
<p>In addition, faculty and staff are using other cloud storage such as Dropbox or OneDrive for similar non-administrative purposes and in similar manner.</p>

<div class="section" id="information-security-training">
<h3>Information Security Training<a class="headerlink" href="#information-security-training" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Each year in August, the week before classes begin, the DWR holds an orientation session, also known as the DWR Opening Session. All returning and new instructors and staff attend the Opening Session to stay up to date on important policies and procedures as well as to help prepare (instructors) for teaching. A key component of this event is to remind everyone of best practices when handling confidential and sensitive information. An announcement will be made at the event advising everyone to check their email for an information security video. Each person in the DWR will be expected to watch and acknowledge watching the entire video. Their electronic acknowledgement will be saved in DWR files and the process will be repeated annually at the DWR Opening Session.</p>
<p>Annual training about the department’s backup policy will also be offered to all members of the department at the DWR Opening session.</p>
<p>Additionally, training will be provided for all new hires during the year through one-on-one meetings, workshops, pre-recorded webinars, and online tutorials to ensure all DWR employees are informed on how to protect confidential and sensitive information.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sensitive-data">
<h3>Sensitive Data<a class="headerlink" href="#sensitive-data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Sensitive data stored on backup or production servers is secured via password-protected, limited-access accounts on those servers in configurations that meet security guidelines set by Telecommunications/Networking, which remotely inspects the access security of those servers monthly. All onsite servers operated by the DWR are physically secured either behind lockable office doors, or by locked security cables affixed to parts of the building infrastructure, or both.</p>

<p>The <strong>administrative coordinator</strong> is responsible for establishing mailboxes for staff and instructors in Lamar Hall and Somerville Hall. In mid-August, new adjunct instructors and other new instructors’ names are added at the end of the mailboxes; alphabetizing and name removals do not take place until the semester has gotten underway due to the high chance of continuous changes (additions/deletions). Two weeks into the fall semester, the administrative coordinator asks one of the graduate assistants to reorganize the mailboxes by removing employees who have been terminated or transferred and notifying them that the DWR is holding their mail. The graduate assistant then alphabetizes the mailboxes after new hires are firmly in place.</p>

<h3>Copy Machine and Toner Management<a class="headerlink" href="#copy-machine-and-toner-management" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>With regard to DWR copiers in Suite B/Lamar Hall, Somerville Hall, and Suite C/Lamar Hall, the <strong>administrative coordinator</strong> is responsible for renewing/negotiating annual maintenance contracts, reviewing monthly/annual charges, checking copier totals at the end of fall/spring semesters and year end, and charging other departments for non-DWR usage. The <strong>administrative coordinator</strong> is also responsible for ordering toner, staples, and copy paper (must be state contract pricing and purchased with the procurement card) used in the copy machines. However, the communications specialist can also handle these requests in the absence of the administrative coordinator. User Codes are assigned by both the administrative coordinator and the communications specialist and are created/cancelled as employees arrive and leave employment with the university. The <strong>administrative coordinator</strong> works with the <strong>communications specialist</strong> in reviewing bi-annual copier reports to determine codes, which have become inactive or are being used by unassigned users. After reviewing the report, they delete inactive or misused codes, as needed. The <strong>communications specialist</strong> and the <strong>administrative coordinator</strong> work together in assessing paper jams and error codes displayed by the copier. Either of them may contact the Vendor for service calls if they are part of a maintenance contract, which covers service calls. If no maintenance contract is in place and the service call requires a fee payment, the administrative coordinator determines when/if a service call is to be made.</p>

The <strong>administrative coordinator</strong> and <strong>communications specialist</strong> work together to maintain and keep an up-to-date inventory of keys. The communications specialist maintains the key inventory list which includes the key code, the room description, further description (if needed), the person to whom the key is issued, and a “check mark” next to any key, which has been checked out. All spare keys are kept in a lock box in the communication specialist’s office. The key to the lock box is kept in the communications specialist’s office which is locked when his/her office is not being used. Both the the <strong>administrative coordinator</strong> and the <strong>communications specialist</strong> have access to the lock box.</p>

<div class="section" id="inventory-audit">
<h3>Inventory Audit<a class="headerlink" href="#inventory-audit" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The <strong>communications specialist</strong> performs the annual departmental inventory verification by comparing actual items to university records. This verification begins when the UM Property Control Officer contacts the DWR each year. The communications specialist prepares for the audit by checking the department’s in-house report and comparing the actual items within SAP (AS02). Missing items will be immediately reported to the department chair so that appropriate action can be taken. When the UM Property Control office conducts their annual audit, the final inventory report will include the <strong>communication specialist’s</strong> signature, the <strong>administrative coordinator’s</strong> signature, the department chair’s signature, and the date that the verification was performed. As a general rule, DWR employees who work with computer assignment and transfers, should email the Communications Specialist (with i.e. UM#123456 in the subject line) any time a equipment is moved from one office to another. This will provide a solid audit trail when looking for equipment, which has been assigned to a room incorrectly in SAP.</p>
<p>Loan Equipment Forms are prepared by the <strong>communications specialist</strong> prior to the removal of any university property from campus. These forms must be renewed annually and retained within the department. These forms should be kept up to date (signed annually for repetitive loans) and provided to UM Property Control auditors when their annual audit is conducted.</p>
